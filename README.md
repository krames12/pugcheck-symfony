pugcheck
========
A clean and simple World of Warcraft character look up displaying their current raid progression, as well as logs for that given fight and difficulty if available.


This is a re-write of PugCheck in Symfony v3 from Node.js. The original project is [here](https://github.com/krames12/pug-check)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repo (if you haven't already)
2. Run `composer install` to install all dependancies
3. Run `php bin/console server:start` to start a server locally. ([Symfony 3.2 built-in server docs](https://symfony.com/doc/3.2/setup/built_in_web_server.html))
